                <br>
                <p>When the eagle was descending towards the moon, Neil Armstrong was
                    having difficulty finding a place to land, but luckily he found a 
                    smooth place to land with just 25 seconds of fuel to spare. They 
                    landed on July 20 1969 at 4:18 p.m. EDT.At around 10:40-10:56 p.m. 
                    EDT Neil Armstrong got out of the lunar module hatch and started 
                    going down the nine step ladder. When he was at the second step he pulled a 
                    ring that deployed a tv camera. This camera broadcasted him going down to 
                    the moons surface live to people on earth.At 10:56 p.m. Neil Armstrong takes 
                    his first step on the moon and says his 
                    famous quote "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.".
                    This moment was the first time in history a man had set foot on a celestial
                    body that was not earth.
