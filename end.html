                At 00:56 EDT the vehicle made a burn that removed it from the moons orbit and it went on a return trajectory towards earth.
                when the command module re entered the earths atmosphere at 12:35 EDT after 3 days of travel it became engulfed by plasma 
                due to its speed and the atmosphere's thickness, it briefly lost radio contact when this happened. At 12:51 EDT the commang 
                module lands in the pacific ocean and are picked up by a recovery team. They were sprayed with a disenfectant as a 
                precaution agains pathogens that might have been on the moon.

                The astronauts were collected by a helicopter it dropped them off on the U.S.S Hornet and they were put into a mobile quarantine trailer where
                they remained until they were at the lunar recieving laborotory in Houston Texas. President Nixon welcomed the astronauts and says to them over 
                an intercom "This is the greatest week in the history of the world since the Creation…. As a result of what you have done, the world’s never been closer together 
                . We can reach for the stars just as you have reached so far for the stars."

            <p>
                After 21 days of the astronauts being quarantined they were deeemed healthy and they were allowed to leave. That was the end of the apollo 11 mission, 
                the first time man had set foot on a completely foreign celestial body and it lasted around 8 days. It is revered and looked as a moment of triumph 
                and an example of humanity's greatness. The mission was widely considered successful in nearly every respect.
